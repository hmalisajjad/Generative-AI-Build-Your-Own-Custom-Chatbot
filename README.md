# Generative-AI-Build-Your-Own-Custom-Chatbot
This repository contains the Custom Chatbot Project, where we utilize OpenAI's language model to build a custom chatbot tailored to a specific scenario. The project involves selecting a dataset, integrating it into the chatbot framework, and demonstrating how the chatbot's responses improve with the custom data.

## Features
Load and preprocess a custom dataset for chatbot integration.
Fine-tune a chatbot with the selected dataset.
Perform queries and evaluate the chatbot's performance before and after customization.
Demonstrate the relevance and impact of the dataset through comparative results.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
