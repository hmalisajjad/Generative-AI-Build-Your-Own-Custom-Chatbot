    "For this project, I have chosen the \"2023_fashion_trends.csv\" dataset. This dataset is highly relevant as it contains the latest fashion trends, styles, and narratives from 2023. My goal is to develop a chatbot that will provide fashion enthusiasts and industry professionals with immediate access to the most current trends, style expressions, and emerging fashion concepts. By using this data, the chatbot will be able to respond accurately to inquiries about the latest fashion trends in 2023, offering users current information and helping them stay ahead of the fashion curve."
